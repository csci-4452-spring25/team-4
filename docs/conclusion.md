## Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates a modern cloud-native workflow using Spring Boot, AWS, Terraform, and GitHub Actions. The infrastructure-as-code approach ensures repeatability and scalability, while CI/CD automation accelerates delivery and reduces manual errors. Future improvements could include enhanced monitoring, automated rollbacks, and support for multi-environment deployments.

**Next Steps:**

-   Expand test coverage and add integration tests.
-   Implement advanced monitoring and alerting.
-   Explore blue/green or canary deployment strategies.
-   Document additional onboarding and troubleshooting guides.
